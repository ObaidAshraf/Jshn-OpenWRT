# Jshn-OpenWRT
JSHN in a JSON Parsing Library in OpenWRT using Shell Scripts.

It is an old library and has very limited documentation. OpenWRT supports LUA language which also has powerful tools and libraries to parse JSON string. 
I will upload some examples to use this JSHN in OpenWRT if, in case, someone like to use Shell Scripts to parse JSON.
